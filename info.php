    [
        'question' => 'What is the importance of spaying and neutering pets?',
        'answer' => 'Spaying and neutering pets help control the stray animal population by preventing unwanted litters. This reduces the number of animals that end up in shelters or on the streets. It also improves the health and behavior of pets, contributing to their overall well-being.'
