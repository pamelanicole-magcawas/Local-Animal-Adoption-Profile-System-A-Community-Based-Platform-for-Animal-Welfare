                    However, the growing population of stray animals in the Philippines, especially in urban areas, has become a serious concern. Many of these animals—primarily dogs and cats—face harsh conditions on the streets, struggling to survive without food, shelter, or care. Sadly, they are 
                    often viewed as a public nuisance, which only deepens the challenges they face and reduces the empathy they receive.

                    Yet behind each of these rescues lies a story of resilience, hope, and the journey toward a fresh start. Despite hardships like hunger, illness, or even abuse, these animals continue to show remarkable strength and courage.
